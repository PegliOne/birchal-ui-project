# Birchal UI Interface Project

- This is what I managed to make in 4 hours.

- I started by setting up the components in React, then I added the ability to change the state of the service providers to "installed" once the install button was clicked

- Lastly I used Flexbox and CSS grid to style the page

- Sorry all the logos are React logos, I didn't have time to find any others
